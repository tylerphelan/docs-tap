# Installing the Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles

This document describes how to install Tanzu Application Platform packages
from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

Before you install the packages, ensure that you have completed the prerequisites, configured
and verified the cluster, accepted the EULA, and installed the Tanzu CLI with any required plug-ins.
See [Installing the Tanzu CLI](install-tanzu-cli.md).


## <a id='add-tap-package-repo'></a> Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository

To add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository:

1. If you havenâ€™t completed the
[Install Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu for non-TKG clusters](install-tanzu-cli.md#tanzu-cluster-essentials)
procedure, set up environment variables for use during the installation by running:

    ```
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=TANZU-NET-USER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=TANZU-NET-PASSWORD
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    export TAP_VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    ```

    Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `1.0.1`.

1. Create a namespace called `tap-install` for deploying any component packages by running:

    ```
    kubectl create ns tap-install
    ```

    This namespace keeps the objects grouped together logically.

1. Create a registry secret by running:

    ```
    tanzu secret registry add tap-registry \
      --username ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME} --password ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD} \
      --server ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME} \
      --export-to-all-namespaces --yes --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Add Tanzu Application Platform package repository to the cluster by running:

    ```
    tanzu package repository add tanzu-tap-repository \
      --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:$TAP_VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

    Where `$TAP_VERSION` is the Tanzu Application Platform version environment variable
    you defined earlier.

1. Get the status of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository, and ensure the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

    ```
    tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    - Retrieving repository tap...
    NAME:          tanzu-tap-repository
    VERSION:       121657971
    REPOSITORY:    registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages
    TAG:           1.0.0
    STATUS:        Reconcile succeeded
    REASON:
    ```

    >**Note:** the `VERSION` and `TAG` numbers differ from the example above if you are on
    >Tanzu Application Platform v1.0.1 or later.

1. List the available packages by running:

    ```
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    / Retrieving available packages...

## <a id='install-profile'></a> Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile

The `tap.tanzu.vmware.com` package installs predefined sets of packages based on your profile settings. This is done by using the package manager you installed using Tanzu Cluster Essentials.

For more information about profiles, see [Installation profiles in Tanzu Application Platform](overview.md#profiles-and-packages).

The following profiles are available for Tanzu Application Platform:

- **Full:** This profile contains all of the Tanzu Application Platform packages.

- **Iterate:** This profile is intended for iterative application development.

- **Build:** This profile is intended for the transformation of source revisions to workload revisions. Specifically, hosting workloads and SupplyChains.

- **Run:** This profile is intended for the transformation of workload revisions to running pods. Specifically, hosting deliveries and deliverables.

- **View:** This profile is intended for instances of applications related to centralized developer experiences. Specifically, the TAP GUI and Metadata Store.


To prepare to install a profile:

1. List version information for the package by running:

    ```
    tanzu package available list tap.tanzu.vmware.com --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Create a `tap-values.yml` file by using the
[Full Profile sample](#full-profile) as a guide.
These samples have the minimum configuration required to deploy Tanzu Application Platform.
The sample values file contains the necessary defaults for:

    - The meta-package, or parent Tanzu Application Platform package
    - Subordinate packages, or individual child packages

    The values file you provide during installation is used for further configuration
    of Tanzu Application Platform.

    >**Important:** Keep this file for future use.

1. Proceed to the [View possible configuration settings for your package](#view-pkge-config-settings)
section.

### <a id='full-profile'></a> Full Profile

Where:
- For `buildservice` top level key:
  - `KP-DEFAULT-REPO` is a writable repository in your registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Examples:
      * Harbor has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service"`
      * Dockerhub has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-dockerhub-user/build-service"` or `kp_default_repository: "index.docker.io/my-user/build-service"`
      * Google Cloud Registry has the form `kp_default_repository: "gcr.io/my-project/build-service"`
  - **Registry credentials**: Credentials are required for the `kp_default_repository` and the Tanzu Network registry. They can be applied in the configuration directly via `_username` and `_password` fields or via a Secret with `_secret` nested fields.
      - `kp_default_repository`:
        - `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-USERNAME` is the username that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You should be able to `docker push` to this location with this credential.
            * For Google Cloud Registry, use `kp_default_repository_username: _json_key`
        - `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-PASSWORD` is the password for the user that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential.
            * For Google Cloud Registry, use the contents of the service account json file.

        **or**

        - `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET-NAME` is the name of the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret containing credentials for `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You should be able to `docker push` to this location with this credential.
        - `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace of the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret containing credentials for `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You should be able to `docker push` to this location with this credential.
      - Tanzu Network Registry (`registry.tanzu.vmware.com`)
        - `TANZUNET-USERNAME` and `TANZUNET-PASSWORD` are the email address and password that you use to log in to VMware Tanzu Network.

        **or**

        - `TANZUNET-SECRET-NAME` is the name of the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret containing credentials for VMware Tanzu Network registry.
        - `TANZUNET-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace of the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret containing credentials for VMware Tanzu Network registry.
  - `DESCRIPTOR-NAME` is the name of the descriptor to import. See more details [here](tanzu-build-service/tbs-about.html#dependencies-descriptors). Available options are:
      * `lite` (default if unset) has a smaller footprint that enables faster installations.
      * `full` optimized to speed up builds and includes dependencies for all supported workload types.
- `SERVER-NAME` is the hostname of the registry server. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `server: "my-harbor.io"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `server: "index.docker.io"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `server: "gcr.io"`
- `REPO-NAME` is where workload images are stored in the registry.
Images are written to `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME/workload-name`. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `repository: "my-dockerhub-user"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`
- `SSH-SECRET-KEY` is the SSH secret key supported by the specific package.
See [Identify the SSH secret key for your package](#ssh-secret-key) for more information.
- `DOMAIN-NAME` has a value such as `learningcenter.example.com`.
- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's External IP address.
- `GIT-CATALOG-URL` is the path to the `catalog-info.yaml` catalog definition file. You can download either a blank or populated catalog file from the [Tanzu Application Platform product page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-application-platform/#/releases/1043418/file_groups/6091). Otherwise, you can use a Backstage-compliant catalog you've already built and posted on the Git infrastructure you specified in the Integration section.
- `MY-DEV-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you want the `ScanTemplates` to be deployed to.
This is the namespace where the scanning feature is going to run.
- `TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET` is the name of the secret that contains the
credentials to pull an image from the registry for scanning.
If built images are pushed to the same registry as the Tanzu Application Platform images,
this can reuse the `tap-registry` secret created in
[Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository](#add-tap-package-repo).

>**Note:** When using the `tbs-values.yaml` configuration,
>`enable_automatic_dependency_updates: true` causes the dependency updater to update
>Tanzu Build Service dependencies (buildpacks and stacks) when they are released on
>VMware Tanzu Network. Use `false` to pause the automatic update of Build Service dependencies.
>When automatic updates are paused, the pinned version of the descriptor for TAP 1.1.0 is [100.0.279](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies#/releases/1066670)
>If left undefined, this value is `false`.

### <a id='light-profile'></a> Light Profile

The Light profile is deprecated. Although existing values files might still refer to the Light profile, VMware recommends to migrate to one of the new profiles described in [Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile](#install-profile) by following the procedures in [Migrate Tanzu Application Platform profiles](migrate-profile.md).

### <a id="view-pkge-config-settings"></a>View possible configuration settings for your package

To view possible configuration settings for a package, run:

```
tanzu package available get tap.tanzu.vmware.com/$TAP_VERSION --values-schema --namespace tap-install
```

Where `$TAP_VERSION` is the Tanzu Application Platform version environment variable
you defined earlier.

>**Note:** The `tap.tanzu.vmware.com` package does not show all configuration settings for packages
>it plans to install. The package only shows top-level keys.
>View individual package configuration settings with the same `tanzu package available get` command.
>For example, use `tanzu package available get -n tap-install cnrs.tanzu.vmware.com/1.0.3 --values-schema` for Cloud Native Runtimes.

This section only applies when you use Tanzu Application Platform to deploy its own shared Contour ingress controller in `tanzu-system-ingress`. It is not applicable when you use your own existing ingress.

You can share this ingress across Cloud Native Runtimes (`cnrs`), Tanzu Application Platform GUI (`tap_gui`), and Learning Center (`learningcenter`).

By default, Contour uses `NodePort` as the service type. To set the service type to `LoadBalancer`, add the following to your `tap-values.yml`:

```
contour:
  envoy:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
```

If you are using AWS, the section above creates a classic LoadBalancer.
If you want to use the Network LoadBalancer instead of the classic LoadBalancer for ingress, add the
following to your `tap-values.yml`:

```
contour:
  infrastructure_provider: aws
  envoy:
    service:
      aws:
        LBType: nlb
```

## <a id='access-tap-gui'></a> Access the Tanzu Application Platform GUI

To access Tanzu Application Platform GUI, you'll be able to use the hostname that is pointed at the shared ingress you configure above. If you'd prefer a LoadBalancer for Tanzu Application Platform GUI then you can see how to configure that in the [Accessing Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-gui/accessing-tap-gui.md) section.


You're now ready to start using Tanzu Application Platform GUI.
Proceed to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) topic or the
[Tanzu Application Platform GUI - Catalog Operations](tap-gui/catalog/catalog-operations.md) topic.


## <a id='exclude-packages'></a> Exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile

To exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile:

1. Find the full subordinate (child) package name:

    ```
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Update your `tap-values` file with a section listing the exclusions:

    ```
    profile: PROFILE-VALUE
    excluded_packages:
      - tap-gui.tanzu.vmware.com
      - service-bindings.lab.vmware.com
    ```

>**Note:** If you decide to exclude a package after performing a profile installation which included that package, you cannot see the the accurate package states immediately after running `tap package installed list -n tap-install`.

>**Note:** You can break package dependencies by removing a package. Allow 20 minutes to verify that all packages have reconciled correctly while troubleshooting.
